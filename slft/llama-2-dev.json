The primary CTR section includes,\n Outcome Measurement: \n  Progression-free Survival (PFS) and to Evaluate Safety of the Trastuzumab, Bevacizumab and Docetaxel Regimen.\n  The trial was designed as a single-stage phase II rather then usual two-stage design because of the progression free survival (PFS) primary endpoint, as it is impractical to wait to assess PFS for patients in the first stage. We will consider a PFS of 50% at twelve months (median PFS of 12 months) or less uninteresting and a PFS of 70% at twelve months (median PFS of twenty months) worthy of pursuing the regimen in a future trials. The single-stage design is as follows: p0=0.50, p1=0.70, \u03b1=0.10, \u03b2= 0.10. This leads to a total sample size of 39 patients, 24 or higher of who are progression-free at 12 months.\n  Time frame: up to 3 years\nResults 1: \n  Arm/Group Title: Trastuzumab, Bevacizumab, and Docetaxel\n  Arm/Group Description: Trastuzumab [6mg/kg], Bevacizumab [15mg/kg], and Docetaxel [75 mg/M ]\n  Overall Number of Participants Analyzed: 26\n  Median (95% Confidence Interval)\n  Unit of Measure: months  14.3        (9.3 to 35)[/INST] Based on the provided evidence, \n I think the relationship is \"Entailment\".</s>"
