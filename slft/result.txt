[{'generated_text': '<s>[INST] <<SYS>>\nYou are a helpful assistant. You are going to determine the inference relation (entailment or contradiction) between pairs of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and the statements, making claims about one of the summarized sections of the CTRs: Results.<</SYS>>. This task type is "Single". There is only one CTR. The statement is "All the primary trial patients had a minimum of 50% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions". The primary CTR section includes,\n Outcome Measurement: \n  Complete Response + Partial Response + Stable Disease > 24 Weeks\n  Clinical Outcome measured using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST,)V1.0, and assessed by MRI or CT: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), >=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Stable Disease (SD), a tumor that is neither growing nor shrinking.\n  A patient has clinical benefit from treatment if CR + PR + SD > 24 weeks.\n  Time frame: 24 weeks\nResults 1: \n  Arm/Group Title: Sorafenib and Anastrozole\n  Arm/Group Description: All patients receive sorafenib and anastrozole.\n  Overall Number of Participants Analyzed: 35\n  Measure Type: Number\n  Unit of Measure: participants  35[/INST] Based on the provided evidence, \n I think the relationship is "Contradiction". The primary CTR section includes the statement, "All the primary trial patients had a minimum of 50% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions". The statement is in contrast to the primary CTR section, which states that the primary trial patients had a minimum of 50% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions. Therefore, based on the provided evidence, the relationship is "Contradiction".'}]
